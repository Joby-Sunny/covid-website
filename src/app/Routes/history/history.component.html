            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the
                coronavirus pandemic,
                is
                an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus
                disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">
                The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared
                a
                Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later
                declared a
                pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 17 April 2021, more than 140 million cases have been confirmed, with
                more
                than 3 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">Although it is still unknown exactly where
                the first case
                originated from, the first outbreak started in
                Wuhan, Hubei, China in late 2019. Many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who had
                visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan On 11 February 2020, the World Health
                Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019. The
                virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
                a
                newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and
                SARS-CoV. Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus that arose from bats in a natural
                setting</p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">The earliest known person with symptoms was
                later discovered
                to
                have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that
                person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. However, an earlier case
                of infection could have occurred on 17 November. Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two
                thirds were found to have a link with the market. There are several theories about when and
                where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.</p>
            <h3 class="font-sans text-base text-gray-600 mx-auto mb-2 mt-3 font-bold w-11/12">Cases</h3>
            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">
                Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has
                been
                confirmed positive according to official protocols. Many countries, early on, had official policies
                to not test those with only mild symptoms. An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23
                January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented
                infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases. Several other studies, using a variety of
                methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably
                greater
                than the reported cases.

            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">
                On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a
                major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies. Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant
                women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody
                tests
                that may indicate more infections than reported. Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as
                some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. Some results (such
                as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer
                review.

            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">
                Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under
                20. It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less
                likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested. A retrospective cohort
                study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.

                Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and
                2.5, but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval
                of 3.8 to 8.9). R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction
                number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd
                immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the
                spread
                of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.

            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">There is no specific, effective treatment or
                cure for
                coronavirus
                disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused
                by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, the cornerstone of management of COVID-19 is supportive care, which
                includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed,
                and
                medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.</p>
            <p class="font-sans text-base text-gray-500 mx-auto mb-2 w-5/6">Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these,
                supportive care
                includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs
                to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal
                breathing. Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended. The U.S.
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those who suspect they are carrying the
                virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.</p>
